# Data-analysis-fandango-ratings
Is Fandango Using Artificial Ratings?

This is my first data analysis project and is a capstone in the Udemy course "Python for Machine Learning and Data Science."
this is my first project, it will be guided and is based on the findings of GitHub user 538, but all the coding, sorting of data, and visualizations, etc., will all be done by me.
The end goal is to use the data to try and find out if Fandango is using false reviews to perhaps boost ticket sales, but on the way I am going to explore the data in detail to practise my skills in Pandas and Seaborn.
